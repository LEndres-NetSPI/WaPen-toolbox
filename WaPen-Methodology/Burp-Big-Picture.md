# Audit Scanning
### `Audit Items` is all you care about
Steps:
- Manually crawl your app w/ passive scanning enabled
- Gather all your `GET` requests (initially, blasting all `POSTS` can be dangerous) and right-click --> `Do active scan`
- Once completed, view your findings in the `Issue activity` page
