# UNION attacks

MySQL end of query = `--` and `#`, **try both**.

PS Lab `Lab: SQL injection attack, querying the database type and version on MySQL and Microsoft` rejected my accurate queries because I ended my query with `--` instead of `#`. Is this accurate of a real-world setup? I'm not sure.
