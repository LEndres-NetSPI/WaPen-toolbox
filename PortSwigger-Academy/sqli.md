# UNION attacks

MySQL end of query = `--` and `#`, **try both**.

UNION select attacks not working on PS labs. I think this is intentional and doesn't reflect a real-world setup. They are training you on hard-mode.

PS Lab `Lab: SQL injection attack, querying the database type and version on MySQL and Microsoft` rejected my accurate queries because I ended my query with `--` instead of `#`
